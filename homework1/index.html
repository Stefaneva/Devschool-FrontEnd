                        <h3>Exploring</h3>
                        <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is a Western-themed action-adventure game set in an open world
                            environment. It is played from either a third or first-person perspective and the player
                            controls Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and a member of the Van der Linde gang.</p>
                        <p>The game features both single-player and online multiplayer components.The game brings back
                            and deeply refines mechanics from the previous game, such as the combat, gunplay, honor
                            system and more. It also has many new features, including dual-wielding and swimming.</p>
                        <p>The game focuses heavily on player choice for the story and missions. During IGN's first
                            look preview on the topic of how player choices can affect interactions and missions, Rob
                            Nelson, Co-Studio Head at Rockstar North, said: "We try to give you options within a lot of
                            these missions to choose how you approach it, whether you'll send your buddies in first or
                            whether you'll go in first."</p>
                        <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 features item degradation, with equipment such as weapons requiring
                            cleaning and oiling. The player can visit a barber to change hairstyles; however, styles
                            are only available to players depending on how much hair their character has, with hair
                            growing realistically throughout the title over time. Morgan can also gain or lose weight
                            depending on how much he eats, a feature absent from previous Rockstar games since Grand
                            Theft Auto: San Andreas. Characters have different sets of clothes for different weather
                            conditions and also have to regularly eat and bathe. Some actions that were once more
                            automatic have been greatly expanded upon in detail, including skinning a kill and
                            examining objects.</p>

                        <h3>Hunting</h3>
                        <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 features both hunting and fishing, which provide food, income and
                            materials for crafting items. When hunting an animal, players will need to move slowly and
                            carefully and watch the wind direction to avoid alerting their prey. Choice of weapon and
                            shot placement are also important and will affect the quality of the meat and pelt, which
                            in turn affects the price that traders will pay for them. If prey are injured, they will
                            try to escape.</p>
                        <p>After a successful hunt, players can either skin and butcher the animal on the spot or take
                            it with them whole. Animal skins and carcasses will rot over time if not properly tended
                            to, and this both decreases their value while making them stink, and makes the character a
                            target for wild animals when out of town. Skins, parts, meat, and entire carcasses can all
                            be loaded onto horses to be sold to the butchers or the general store in town, taken back
                            to camp for the stew pot, or crafted into clothing or other items. Trappers can craft more
                            exotic goods for players.</p>

                        <h3>Merketing</h3>
                        <p>The game's debut trailer was released on October 20, 2016, depicting the open world
                            environment, and the second and third trailers—released on September 28, 2017, and May 2,
                            2018, respectively—introduced the game's characters and story. A trailer released on August
                            9 features the first gameplay footage. It demonstrates the shooting and horse mechanics,
                            and the ability to maintain the player's gang and camps. To spur pre-order sales, Rockstar
                            collaborated with several retail outlets to provide special edition versions of the game.
                            The "Special Edition" includes exclusive single-player content, while the "Ultimate
                            Edition" features additional online content. The "Collector's Box" is a collection of
                            physical merchandise relating to the game.</p>
